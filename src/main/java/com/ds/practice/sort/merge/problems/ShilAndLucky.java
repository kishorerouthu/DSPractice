 * Created by kishore on 9/2/17.

 * Shil is your new boss and he likes lucky strings very much. A string is called lucky if and only if each character from first half of the string  * can be paired to each character from second half of the string. AND:
 * In each pair, a character from the first half is strictly greater than a character from the second half OR
 * In each pair, a character from the first half is strictly lesser than a character from the second half OR
 * In each pair, a character from the first half is equal to character from the second half.
 * Each character should be used exactly once in pairing.
 * Your are given a string S. You want to change the minimum number of characters to make this string lucky so that you can gift it to your boss.
 * Note that each character in lucky string should be in lower case alphabet ( 'a' - 'z' ).
 *
 * Input format:
 * The first line consists of an integer N. The second line consists of N lower case characters.
 *
 * Output format:
 * Print minimum number of changes required to make given string lucky.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 < N â‰¤ 105
 * N will be an even integer.
 * Sample Input(Plaintext Link)
 * 6
 * aabbbb
 * Sample Output(Plaintext Link)
 * 1
 * Explanation
 * To satisfy case 1, number of changes required is 3.
 * To satisfy case 2, number of changes requires is 1.
 * To satisfy case 3,number of changes required is 2.
 *
 *
 *
 * Note that the problem is equivalent to 3 subproblems:
 *
 * finding the optimal pairing of characters such that the number of x such that a[x] = b[x] is true
 * finding the optimal pairing of characters such that the number of x such that a[x] < b[x] is true
 * finding the optimal pairing of characters such that the number of x such that a[x] > b[x] is true
 *
 * For example, if strings are deada and patel, then since a[1] < b[1], a[3] < b[3], and a[5] < b[5], there are 3 such x in the 2nd case.
 * So we can change only the 2nd and 4th character of the first string to make it less than the second string.
 * (Or if that character is 'a', change the last character of the corresponding second half)
 *
 * Consider the cases.
 * Case 1 :
 * Count number of each character (a to z) in first half and last half, and for each a to z,
 * add min(ct[a], ct2[z]) to sum. O(N + 26O(1)) = O(N).
 * Example: say string is weedshwe. Then, ct[w] = 1, ct[e] = 2, ct[d] = 1 for the first half, 'weed', and ct2[s] = ct2[h] = ct2[w] = ct2[e] = 1.
 * And everything else 0. So, answer would be min(ct[a], ct2[a]) + ... + min(ct[z], ct2[z]) = 2.
 * So we have 2 that are in correct position, so 4 - 2 changes to be made.
 *
 * Case 3 :
 * Now for the other two cases. FIrst we take a[x] > b[x].
 * We first sort the two halves and take characters in a fashion similar to that of merge in mergesort.
 * For example, say string is deadtark.
 * Call the remaining strings S1, S2.
 * First half is dead, second half is tark. Sort the strings by character.
 * At start, S1 = arkt, S2 = adde.
 * We compare top character of s1 with top character of s2. We discard first character of S1 if both are equal.
 * So since a = a, S1 = rkt, S2 = adde.
 * So now, first characters satisfy property, r > a.
 * So we increment count by 1 and remove both characters: S1 = kt, S2 = dde.
 * Same goes for last 2 characters, so ct = 3.
 * And answer would be (length of half - ct) = 4-3 = 1.
 * Complexity O(N).
 *
 * We take minimum of these 3 cases, it's our answer.
