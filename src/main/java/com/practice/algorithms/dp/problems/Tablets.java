/**
 * Created by kishore on 2/5/17.
 *
 * Therasa is a Nurse. She wants to give some tablets to the patients in her practice.
 * All the patients sit in a line and each of them has a rating score according to his or her health score.
 * Therasa wants to give at least 1 tablet for each patient.
 * Patients get jealous of their immediate neighbors,
 * so if two patients sit next to each other then the one with the higher rating must get more tablets.
 * Therasa wants to save money, so she wants to minimize the total number of tablets.
 *
 * Input
 * The first line of the input is an integer N, the number of patients in Therasaâ€™s practice.
 * Each of the following N lines contains an integer indicates the health score of each patient.
 *
 * Output
 * Output a single line containing the minimum number of tablets Therasa must give.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= N <= 100000
 * 1 <= health score <= 100000
 *
 * SAMPLE INPUT
 * 3
 * 1
 * 2
 * 2
 *
 * SAMPLE OUTPUT
 * 4
 *
 * Explanation
 * Here 1, 2, 2 is the health score. Note that when two patients have equal health score they are allowed to have different number of tablets.
 * Hence optimal distribution will be 1, 2, 1.
