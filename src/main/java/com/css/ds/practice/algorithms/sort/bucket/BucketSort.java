/**
 * Created by kishore on 12/3/17.
 *
 * Bucket sort is mainly useful when input is uniformly distributed over a range.
 * For example, consider the following problem.
 * Sort a large set of floating point numbers which are in range from 0.0 to 1.0 and are uniformly distributed across the range.
 * How do we sort the numbers efficiently?
 *
 * A simple way is to apply a comparison based sorting algorithm.
 * The lower bound for Comparison based sorting algorithm (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Î©(n Log n), i.e.,
 * they cannot do better than nLogn.
 * Can we sort the array in linear time? Counting sort can not be applied here as we use keys as index in counting sort.
 * Here keys are floating point numbers.
 * The idea is to use bucket sort. Following is bucket algorithm.
 *
 * bucketSort(arr[], n)
 * 1) Create n empty buckets (Or lists).
 * 2) Do following for every array element arr[i].
 * .......a) Insert arr[i] into bucket[n*array[i]]
 * 3) Sort individual buckets using insertion sort.
 * 4) Concatenate all sorted buckets.
 *
 * Time Complexity: If we assume that insertion in a bucket takes O(1) time then steps 1 and 2 of the above algorithm clearly take O(n) time.
 * The O(1) is easily possible if we use a linked list to represent a bucket (In the following code, C++ vector is used for simplicity). Step 4 also  * * takes O(n) time as there will be n items in all buckets.
 * The main step to analyze is step 3.
 * This step also takes O(n) time on average if all numbers are uniformly distributed (please refer CLRS book for more details)
